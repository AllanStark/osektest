* Issues in OSEK Conformance Tests *

  OSEK-OS specifies the conformance tests over the MODISTAR specification which can be found under:
  
  http://portal.osek-vdx.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=18
  
  These tests have been written for OSEK-OS 2.0.0 but the last OSEK-OS version is the 2.2.3. This OSEK-OS is implemented conform to 2.2.3 and therefore some test cases can not executed.

  ** Interrupt Processing **
  
  The sequence 2 of the Interrupt Processing test can not be implemented, the interface EnableInterrupt and DisableInterrupt are not more part of the standard. The following interfaces are aviable for the handling of interrupts:
  
  * DisableAllInterrupt/EnableAllInterrupt
  * SuspendAllInterrupt/ResumeAllInterrupt
  * SuspendOsInterrupt/ResumeOsInterrupt
  
  All this interfaces have void a return type. The test checks the return of this interfaces which is not possible since it is void.
